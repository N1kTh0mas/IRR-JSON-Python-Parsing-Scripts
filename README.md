# IRR JSON Python Parsing Scripts
 A set of scripts for the the game Incursion Red River to parse specific json files form game data and export spreadsheets

## Currently Supported Files
```
DT_Vendor.json
DefaultGameplayTags.ini
DA_VendorSettings.json
All DA_LootContainer Json Files
All DA_Inventory AI Loadouts Json Files
```

### These Scripts are a Work In Progress!!!
Please keep in mind that these scripts are not perfect and still have many bugs!


### Notes
In the game files, The Vendor_DT item names don't always match up with the GameplayTags and true names located inside of each ID/BP file of the item.

There are multiple old names in the Gameplay tags for current items as well as prior items that are no longer in the game or used in testing
